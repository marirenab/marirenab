👋 Hi, I’m @marirenab!

👀 I’m passionate about using machine learning to advance healthcare and biological research!

🌱 Currently working on:

Developing machine learning models to screen and predict Parkinson’s Disease using multimodal data (proteomics + accelerometer/sensor data).

Exploring how to integrate deep learning and interpretable models for clinical translation.

💡 Previous work:

Screening agitation in dementia using passive sensor data.

Designing interactive, user-friendly interfaces for clinical settings.
💞️ I'm enthusiastic about collaborating large language models on structured and unstructured data. Additionally, I'm keen on exploring collaborations involving deep learning techniques applied to -omics data. If you share my passion for advancing healthcare through innovative machine learning approaches, let's connect!
