## Hi, I’m @marirenab

I’m passionate about applying machine learning to advance healthcare and biological research.

### Currently working on
- Developing machine learning models to screen and predict Parkinson’s Disease using multimodal data (proteomics, electronic health record data, and accelerometer/sensor data).
- Exploring approaches to integrate deep learning and interpretable models for clinical translation.

### Previous work
- Screening agitation in dementia using passive sensor data.
- Designing interactive, user-friendly interfaces for clinical settings.

I’m particularly interested in collaborations involving deep learning techniques applied to -omics data.  
If you share my passion for advancing healthcare through innovative machine learning approaches, feel free to connect.
